## Key differences

- **Website**: Usually they provide information to users, also provide some level of interaction. Implemented using Apache server
    - __Static__ -> The static websites doesn't have interaction with a database or an application in the server, so all users obtain the same data. They do not interact with users but are faster and cheaper.
    - __Dynamic__ -> Content is generated on the fly, and can generate responses based on the input. They interact with users but need more time to process requests, also they are more expensive than static. 
- **Web application**: High level of interaction with users, they are designed to store, analyze and manipulate data. Implemented using Tomcat
